# Interconnected-Office-Branch-Network-Simulation
Interconnected Office Branch Network Simulation

## Description
This project demonstrates a comprehensive network topology designed for interconnected office branches using Cisco Packet Tracer. It showcases how multiple office networks (branches) can communicate efficiently via routers, switches, and servers. The topology includes multiple LANs interconnected through a backbone network.

### Features
Multiple Branch Offices:
Each branch has its own LAN with switches and devices like PCs, laptops, and servers.
Each LAN is assigned unique subnets for effective IP management.
Centralized Servers:
Servers are deployed across the branches to handle local and remote data access.
Backbone Network:
A network backbone interconnects all routers for seamless inter-branch communication.
Device Diversity:
Mix of desktop PCs, laptops, and other devices for a realistic simulation.
Testing and Validation:
Ping tests across devices to verify interconnectivity and proper routing.

#### Purpose
To design and simulate a scalable network that connects multiple office branches.
To provide a hands-on learning experience for networking concepts like routing, switching, and subnetting.
To demonstrate best practices for inter-branch communication and network segmentation.

##### How to Use
Open the .pkt file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
Examine the network layout and device configurations.
Perform connectivity tests using the ping tool from one branch to another.
Modify the topology to add more branches or devices as needed.

##### Network Details
Branch LANs:
Each branch has a dedicated subnet and network devices.
Routing:
Inter-branch routing is handled by interconnected routers.
Switches:
Each branch LAN uses switches for device management.
IP Addressing:
Subnetting is implemented for logical division of the network.

##### Skills Demonstrated
Advanced subnetting for large-scale networks.
Router and switch configuration for inter-branch communication.
Network testing and troubleshooting.
Backbone network design for scalability.

##### Future Improvements
Implement VLANs to enhance security and traffic management.
Add redundancy using protocols like HSRP or VRRP.
Simulate real-world traffic using Packet Tracer tools.

##### Prerequisites
Cisco Packet Tracer installed.
Understanding of networking concepts like subnetting, routing, and switching.
